## Gemini Integration (Safety-Governed)

Gemini is used exclusively as an action proposal generator.

All proposed actions are deterministically evaluated by the
Causal Safety Engine before execution.

Gemini has:
- no access to execution
- no access to policy
- no ability to override decisions

This integration demonstrates agent governance,
not autonomous decision-making.
